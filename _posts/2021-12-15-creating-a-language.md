The pursuit of a linguistics concentration at MIT led me to take what I believe to be the linguistics department's best class: 24.917, or Constructed Languages.

Building off of 24.900 (Intro to Linguistics), this class walks you through the basics of linguistics and their applications, both in "real" languages like Arabic and Mandarin, and "fake" languages like Klingon or Dothraki. The somewhat weekly assignments were various tasks that guided you through the process of making a language from scratch, slowly but surely building up to the final project: a grammar of your invented language.  The introduction to my language goes as follows:

> After a cataclysm level event (circa 2200AD, take your pick, there are many on the horizon), humanity as a species has to reinvent language (maybe this time, we can skip all the extra letters and get straight to business). This language is "The First Spoken Language Part II, Electric Boogaloo". Used by the coolest of the cool (those who did not perish in \[redacted for brevity, and storyteller laziness\]), this language consists of a series of grunts, huffs, howls, and when needed, some pointing.
>
> My Protolanguage will be called "Ancea", or "I clearly grunted Oat Milk how dare you pour me Whole you know I can't have that" or "The first ever fatal disagreement"
>
> NOTE: for a reason historians have yet to figure out, a lot of the jokes surrounding this language seem to only be funny to one young adult male who happened to reside in what was at the time (lesser) known as Cambridge.  In the year 2800AD this became one of the Millennium Problems. In the year 2825AD a famed linguist is said to have exclaimed "Trying to understand this idiot's sense of humor has got to be as hard as nuclear cold fusion". This linguist was widely mocked when, in 2826AD, cold fusion was solved.

If that introduction piqued your interest, my entire project is linked below.

Feel free to use my language in any of your creations, just contact me to let me know. [For iOS](../../assets/files/ConLangsFinalProject.pdf)
